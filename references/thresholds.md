# Trading Guardian — Thresholds

Numeric limits Trading Guardian uses to decide whether a trade is **simple**, **light Guardian**, or **full Guardian**. Edit the numbers here freely — this file doesn't affect the workflow logic in `SKILL.md`.

If any one threshold below crosses into "light" or "full," the whole trade escalates to that tier — tiers don't average across categories.

## 1. Position size vs account equity
| Range | Tier |
|---|---|
| < 5% of equity | Simple |
| 5–15% of equity | Light Guardian |
| > 15% of equity | Full Guardian |

## 2. Leverage (futures)
| Range | Tier |
|---|---|
| ≤ 3x | Simple |
| 4x – 10x | Light Guardian |
| > 10x | Full Guardian (always flag as high-risk regardless of size) |

## 3. Funding rate (futures, per 8h)
| Range | Treatment |
|---|---|
| -0.03% to 0.03% | Normal — don't mention |
| > 0.03% or < -0.03% (up to ±0.1%) | Elevated — raise in Devil's Advocate |
| > 0.1% or < -0.1% | Extreme — explicit warning, expensive to hold |

## 4. Position reduction / close size
| Range | Tier |
|---|---|
| < 30% of holding in that symbol | Simple |
| 30% – 70% | Light Guardian |
| > 70% (or closing to zero) | Full Guardian |

## 5. Concentration
- Single asset > 40% of total equity → flag concentration risk
- Correlated group (e.g. BTC + ETH + SOL as "crypto beta") > 60% of total equity → flag even if no single asset is individually over 40%
- For assets outside the BTC/ETH/SOL example: treat large-cap coins that move closely with BTC (high historical correlation, e.g. most top-20 non-stablecoin majors) as part of the "crypto beta" group too. Stablecoins are never part of this group. If it's genuinely unclear whether an asset is correlated enough to group, default to flagging rather than skipping the check.

## 6. Momentum (Devil's Advocate input)
- 24h price move > ±7% in the *same direction* as the requested trade → flag as "chasing momentum"

## Defaults / fallback
- Default account base currency: USDT
- Default market: USDⓈ-M Futures (not COIN-M) for futures trades
- Default margin type: Cross
- If equity/portfolio data can't be retrieved, treat the trade as Light Guardian minimum — don't silently execute without exposure context.

## Notes
These are starting-point defaults, not fixed rules — revisit as account size, trading style, or risk tolerance changes.
